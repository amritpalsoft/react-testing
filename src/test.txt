react uses "react-testing-libray" for testing purpose

But it also have "react-scripts" as a dependency which have "jest" as a dependency

So in all react uses a combination of "rtl" and "jest"

A sample test looks like :

test("name of test","test function","time") --> but time is optional and by-default it is 5 seconds 

test('renders learn react link', () => {
  render(<App />);
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});

a test uses "render" method and "screen" from "react test library" 

Render creates a Virtual DOM of the component to be tested 

"test" & "expect" method are imported from "jest" and are avialble globally in "create-react-app"

From react 17 version ,we do not require to import "react" in a component
